        <h3>In this project, I primarily focused on developing the JavaScript functionality. I handled tasks such as fetching data from APIs, processing it, and updating the UI dynamically based on user input or API responses. My main goal was to ensure smooth user interactions and contribute to debugging and refining the JavaScript. I want to give credit to a team member who significantly contributed to the functionality of the JavaScript part of our project. They worked closely with me to develop various features, including data fetching, processing, and UI updates. My favorite food is Griot & Tostones.</h3>
